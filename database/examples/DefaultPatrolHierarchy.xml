        <!-- Uncomment the following stanza to remove "State Change" alarms from the
             alarm display for the adapter.  State Change alarms are always emanated
             as the result of a parameter changing the state of an instance, and perhaps
             the application class of the parameter.  The machine state may also change,
             and emanate an event.

             These events may not be useful for a given business situation, since the
             original "root cause" alarm is the parameter changing state, which is
             always reflected in Formula properly.
