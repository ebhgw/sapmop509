# Title:        Icon "element class" name alias file
#
# Description:  Managed Objects v4 contains an extensive icon library for representing
#               elements of a certain type graphically.  This file contains
#               user-defined mappings of element class names (see an
#               element's properties for its class name). to the canonical
#               names contained within Managed Objects v4's icon library.
#
#               This file is used to overcome the situation where element
#               class names cannot be controlled easily, or are tied to a
#               management system which won't be changed due to legacy
#               issues, maintentance, etc.  To map an element class name to
#               an alias, place elementClassName=iconName pairs on separate
#               lines.
#
#               To view the icon names contained within Managed Objects, point a
#               browser at the Managed Objects internal web server using the address:
#
#                   http://(web address)/icons/list
#
#               commonly,
#
#                   http://localhost:8080/icons/list
#
#
# Examples:
#
#               myRouterBrand=device_router
#               someLAN=net_lan
