     Please refer to the hierarchy.dtd file in your Formula(tm)
     installation directory for details on the definition of this file.
     
     In this file, you can specify alarm fields in order to generate
     new elements or compare field values.

     
     The fields available for 'break-out' for the Business Experience Manager are:

     Alarm Types are classified by the following codes for the purpose
     of this documentation so that users can read it easily.  These 
     codes are not used in the BEM integration, only the Field Names specified
     in the second chart should be used in this xml file.  

     All 'Field Names' (Properties) are case sensitive and are 'aliased' when 
     visualized in the column header of the Alarms view in Formula.

     NOTE:  * means the data is not sent when an event is forwarded by the BEM
              monitor.
