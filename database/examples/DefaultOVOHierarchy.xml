<!--
  In this file, you can specify alarm fields in order to generate
  new elements or compare field values.

  If the adapter property "EnforceResponsibilityMatrix" is set "true" then
  messages that would normally be filtered out based on the operator
  responsibilities matrix for the given OVO User (specified in the "OVOUser"
  adapter property) are filtered out before begin processed by the MODL generator.

  If the adapter property "EnforceResponsibilityMatrix" is set to "false" then
  all of the active messages in ITO can be processed by the MODL generator.
